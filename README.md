# OBS Desktop Duplication API Capture Plugin
By default OBS uses GDI to capture screen which can be an issue if you want to record a game while recording the entire screen or something that has more complex effects then a colored text.

I could not find any plugin that would utilise DDA so I made it myself. I speedrunned it in one evening so you can guess how high quality it is, but hey it works (sometimes)!

You can download the compiled plugin in releases section. If you want to build it yourself, edit include dirs and library paths to OBS source tree.
